# Advanced Ansatz Benchmarking

Results from the ADAPT-VQE and k-UpCCGSD experiments are stored in this
folder. Each subdirectory corresponds to an ansatz and optimizer pair and
contains energy histories, parameter values and metadata logs produced by the
scripts in `scripts/adapt_vqe.py` and `scripts/kupccgsd_vqe.py`.

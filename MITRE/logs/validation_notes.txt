RHF/STO-3G Validation Results - 2025-06-22

1. Phase 2 Reference:
- Source: MITRE/legacy/phase-2/logs/dbt_sto-3g_8e8o_20250526-174457_run.log
- RHF Total Energy: -846.70638670 Hartrees

2. Geometry Comparison:
- Current geometry (MITRE/data/dbt/dbt.geo) and phase-2 geometry (MITRE/legacy/phase-2/src/dibenzothiophene.xyz) are identical
- No structural differences detected

3. Current RHF Verification:
- Could not verify current RHF energy due to:
  * dbt_integrals.npz - Unable to read (access issues)
  * rhf_run_notes.txt - File not found

4. Conclusion:
- Phase 2 RHF energy is properly documented
- Geometries match between versions
- Current RHF energy verification requires access to dbt_integrals.npz
